## The Book Rust chapter 3 projects - The Fibonacci Sequence

At the end of "The Rust Programming Language" book (often called 'The Book'), three projects are mentionned : 
* Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
* Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
* Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song.

This is the first project.
